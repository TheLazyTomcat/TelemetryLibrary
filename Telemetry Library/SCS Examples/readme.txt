This folder contains projects designed to imitate behavior of examples that are 
provided by SCS Software along with their SDK.
An exception is project in folder "telemetry_mem_reader" - this program is not
provided by SCS Software. It is my take on a program that reads shared  memory 
from "telemetry_mem" example.
