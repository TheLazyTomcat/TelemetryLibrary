 * @brief Truck telemetry specific constants for channels.
 *
 * This file defines truck specific telemetry constants which
 * might be used by more than one SCS game. See game-specific
 * file to determine which constants are supported by specific
 * game.
 *
 * Unless state otherwise, following rules apply.
 * @li Whenever channel has float based type (float, fvector, fplacement)
 *     is can also provide double based values (double, dvector, dplacement)
 *     and vice versa. Note that using the non-native type might incur
 *     conversion costs or cause precision loss (double->float in
 *     world-space context).
 * @li Whenever channel has u32 type is can also provide u64 value.
 *     Note that using the non-native type might incur conversion costs.
 * @li Whenever channel uses placement based type (dplacement, fplacement),
 *     it also supports euler type containg just the rotational part and
 *     dvector/fvector type containing just the positional part.
 * @li Indexed entries are using zero-based indices.
