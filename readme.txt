Content
----------------------------------------
This section describes nature of content of individual folders in this project.

./

  Root folder of the project, Contains licenses and readme file.

./Original source

  Original source files (headers and examples) of the SDK provided by SCS Software.
  They can also be downloaded from this page http://www.eurotrucksimulator2.com/mod_tools.php.
  They are provided alongside this project as a reference for translations and 
  debugging.
  
./Telemetry API Headers

  Header files (originally *.h files) translated to pascal.
  
./Headers Tester

  Simple application used for basic control of translated headers (syntax check).
  
./Condensed API Headers

  Contains file that is created by merging all translated header files into one 
  conglomerate. This file is there to simplify units dependency - you can use only
  one unit in uses clause instead of several individual units where desirable.

./Condenser

  Application used to merge translated header files into one file.

./Condensed Tester

  Simple program used for basic control of condensed (merged) headers.

./Telemetry Library/Source

  All source files for Telemetry Library. All files directly in this folder are
  considered as "core" units of the Telemetry Library, but there are also several 
  subdirectories containing individual specialized parts of the library, namely:

  ./Telemetry Library/Source/Libs
      Other libraries that are used inside the Telemetry Library, for example 
      CRC32 calculations.

  ./Telemetry Library/Source/Log
      Units containing classes used for logging of telemetry and API actions
      (textual and binary loggers).

  ./Telemetry Library/Source/SCS
      Examples provided by SCS Software along with the SDK translated to pascal.
      They are not exact translations, rather pascal reimplementation designed 
      to imitate behavior of originals.

  ./Telemetry Library/Source/Comm
      Communication part, currently under development.

./Telemetry Library/Tester

  Application used for testing and debugging of Telemetry Library. Actual code
  of this app changes wery often, according to what part of the library needs
  testing or is under development.

./Telemetry Library/Examples

  Example programs and plugins showing how to use Telemetry Library and its parts.
  Currently, following examples are included:

  ./Telemetry Library/Examples/TextLogger
      Plugin implementing text logger (output is plaintext file).

  ./Telemetry Library/Examples/BinaryLogger
      Plugin implementing binary logger (output is binary file of special 
      format - you can find complete specification of this format in documentation).

  ./Telemetry Library/Examples/LogConverter
      Small program inplementing binary lot to text log converter. You can use this
      program to convert binary logs to human-readable form.

./Telemetry Library/SCS Examples
